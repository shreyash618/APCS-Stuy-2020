The difference between using double buffering and not using it with the PlotFilter program 
is in how quickly the points are displayed on the canvas. When I ran the program without enabling double
buffering, the program took longer to plot the points, as it was plotting them individually. Also, since the
points were plotted individually, it seemed like the screen was changing (like in a animation), as points popped
up on the screen to make a map of the US.

But with double buffering, the points were first plotted to a offscreen canvas, and then copied altogether as
a whole to the onscreen canvas (which is the display we see) in very little time. Therefore, when I enabled double 
bufferingand ran the program, I immediately got a canvas with all the points from USA.txt plotted at once. Double 
buffering reduced plotting time and displayed the end result without any sort of animation.
